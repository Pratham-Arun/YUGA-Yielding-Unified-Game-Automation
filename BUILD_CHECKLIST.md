## Troubleshooting Build Issues

### Issue: Build fails with "out of memory"
**Solution**: Increase Node.js memory
```bash
node --max-old-space-size=4096 node_modules/.bin/electron-builder
```

### Issue: Code signing fails (macOS)
**Solution**: Ensure Apple Developer certificate is installed
```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

### Issue: AppImage won't run (Linux)
**Solution**: Make executable
```bash
chmod +x dist/YUGA\ Engine-1.0.0.AppImage
```

### Issue: Installer is too large
**Solution**: Remove unnecessary files from `package.json` build section

### Issue: Build takes too long
**Solution**: 
- Close other applications
- Use SSD for faster I/O
- Increase available RAM
